# cpl-template

Template for TI2606 Concepts of Programming Languages WebLab assignments.

I created this template because working on and debugging the assignments on WebLab is..., not so optimal. This template enables you to work on the assignments from your IDE (IntelliJ is recommended).  Created for the 2017-2018 edition of the course.

Notes:
- You don't have to change `Library`.
- You have to provide your own implementation of `Parser`.
- When copying a new template for `Solution` from WebLab, make sure the object `Solution` is wrapped around it.
- When new things are added to the languages, you can simply copy and paste them from the WebLab notes to `Untyped`.
- If you are going to push your solutions to a Github repo, make sure its private!
